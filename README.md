## I build infrastructure, software and data solutions

- ðŸ”­  In my spare time I've been building out [WordRef](https://word-ref.firebaseapp.com/) - a small app that helps you learn and track difficult words. Stack = React / node.js / Postgres. Bare with the initial load time, while the app cold starts ðŸ˜‰.
